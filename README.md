We, Group 6 in Software Engineering, were required to carry out an information system development project for our organization from the 1st Semester S.Y 2022 – 2023 to 2nd Semester S.Y. 2022 – 2023 following the academic year of College of Computing Studies at Western Mindanao State University.

## System Overview
The system has admin, landlords, and tenants. These three users will be interconnected to create a functional and operational system that meets its system requirements. This project will allow tenants to view property, property units, leases, and invoices online. The rental apartment requires the aspiring tenant to avail of an apartment in person. The landlord will provide an account for the tenant to access the system. The system requires the tenant to log in to view their rental information. The tenant can raise a ticket if there are issues around their apartment. The admin and landlord administer the tenant transactions, tickets, and reports.
